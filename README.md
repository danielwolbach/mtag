# Mtag

Mtag is an easy tool to automatically detect the music in your library and
tag it with metadata. You need a valid API token from AudD (you can use the
API token "test" for testing a few times).

## Example

```sh
mtag --api-token="YOUR_AUDD_API_TOKEN" --root="~/Music"
```

## Install

You can install Mtag on your system:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/octowaddle/mtag.git && cd mtag && cargo install --path .
```
